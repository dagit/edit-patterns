\section{Methodology}

We propose the following workflow for studying software evolution via VCS
data.  First, each version of all source files in the project are
reconstituted from the differences stored within the VCS such that each
version of a file can be parsed by an appropriate language front end.  Each
front-end is configured to map the parsed code to an annotated term (or,
aterm)~\cite{brand00aterm} that represents a standardized serialization of the parse
tree or abstract syntax tree.  Mapping languages to a common aterm format allows
the downstream portions of our workflow to be language-agnostic to a large degree,
with minimal language-specific parameterization.  

Once we have code in an aterm format, we can then apply a structural
differencing algorithm between adjacent versions of each source file (e.g.,
version $n$ of file $f$ is compared to version $n+1$ of file $f$).  The result
of this is a forest of trees that represent the portions of the AST of file
$f$ that changed between versions at the structural level.  These changes can
either be code insertions, deletions, or mutations.  Our differencing is based
on the work of Yang~\cite{yang91diff} whose algorithm was designed for computing
differences between source code versions.  Yang's goal was to improve the
visual presentation of differences in textual diff tools, and our use of their
algorithm to provide input to further tree analysis algorithms is novel.

After reducing the sequence of differences stored in the VCS, we have a large
forest of trees each representing a change that occurred over the evolution of
the software.  At this point, we seek to relate each of these trees via a 
tree similarity metric.  This is achieved by using Yang's algorithm a second time,
but in this case we ignore the sequence of edit operations that it produces and
simply consume the quantitative similarity metric that it produces as a rough
estimate of how closely related two trees are.  (TODO: where to discuss the fact that
this is not a commutative operator).  A threshold parameter is defined in which
two trees with a similarity above the threshold are considered to be part of the same
cluster of difference tress.

Finally, once the set of differences are grouped into clusters of trees that
are similar up to the threshold, we perform antiunification on the entire
cluster to distill all members to a representative code pattern for the
cluster.  The antiunification algorithm as described by
Bulychev~\cite{bulychev08dupe} as part of the clonedigger project
was used, which itself is an implementation of the classical antiunitification
algorithm of Reynolds~\cite{reynolds69antiunification}.

In the following sections, we descibe the steps above in greater detail.

\subsection{Parsing and aterm generation}

One of the most challenging aspects of performing this kind of study on
arbitrary software packages is the availability of robust language parsing
tools.  In the absence of a common intermediate representation or abstract
syntax representation for popular languages, we adopted a standardized
serialization format in the form of annotated terms.  Generation of aterms was
achieved via language-specific parsers.  In this work, we used the
language-java parser available as open source libraries accessible via the
Haskell programming language.

* Example Java AST
* Mapping between them

\subsection{Structural differencing}

Related work on structural change detection~\cite{chawathe96change}.  Tree
diff algorithms~\cite{tai79tree, selkow77tree}.  These may be very
related~\cite{weissgerber06identify, kim07automatic, neamtiu05understand} - I
need to quickly re-scan these to see the overlap.

\subsection{Tree similarity metric and clustering}

Given two trees $t_1$ and $t_2$, we would like to define a similarity metric
such that $d(t_1, t_2) \in [0,1]$, where a similarity of $1$ means that the
trees are identical, and $0$ represents maximal dissimilarity.  In Yang's
algorithm, a similarity score is provided for comparing $t_a$ and $t_b$. This
metric is order dependent, forcing the maximal score to be the size of the
first tree ($t_a$), even if $t_b$ is larger.  If the trees are identical, the
score will be exactly $|t_a|$, the number of nodes in $t_a$.  If they differ,
it will be strictly less than $|t_a|$.  As such, we define our distance
function to be $\frac{d(t_a, t_b)}{|t_a|}$.  This operator is not commutative,
since it is easy to find instances such that $\frac{d(t_b, t_a)}{|t_b|} \neq
\frac{d(t_a, t_b)}{|t_a|}$ when the trees are very different.

Once we have the set of changes that were detected from the VCS history,
we can generate a forest of trees $t_1, \cdots, t_n$ such that we can
compute the $n^2$ distances between all pairs to generate a distance matrix
$D$ where $D_{ij} = d(t_i, t_j)$.  Given a threshold value $\tau$, we can
produce a boolean matrix $D'$ where $D'_{ij} = d(t_i, t_j) > \tau$.  An
example matrix is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:boolmat} for changes observed
in the VCS for PROJECT X where $\tau = 0.9$.  

Given such a matrix, we would like to use information from the Yang
differencing algorithm to distinguish what kind of change each subtree
represents.  Three possibilities exist: a code insertion (a ``left-hole''),
code deletion (a ``right-hole''), and code mutation (a ``mismatch'').  Adding
this information to the difference matrix is important as it allows us to
further refine our view of the code evolution to distinguish code changes from
the insertion or removal of code that occurs over time. For example, when code
is being developed and grown, we expect to see a number of code insertions.
Similarly, when a mass refactoring occurs to simplify code, we would expect to
see a set of code deletions.  When a more subtle refinement occurs, such as
transposition of  code arguments or the addition of a conditional to refine
control flow, we would expect to see mismatches where the tree changes in a
way where the structural change can be thought of as a  coupled deletion and
insertion operation (such as changing a variable name in an expression).

\subsection{Anti-unification and template generation}

Once we have clusters of related code snippets in the form of related
subtrees, we can seek patterns that relate changes.  For example, say we have
a function call $foo()$ where each invocation of the function uses the same
parameters (e.g, $foo(x,y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are always the same). If we add
a new parameter at the end of each call where the variable passed in differs
each time (e.g., $foo(x,y,a)$ and $foo(x,y,b)$), we would like to abstract out
this change as $foo(x,y,VAR)$, where each instance of the change replaces
$VAR$ with whatever concrete variable is used at that point.  The anti-unification
algorithm is built for this purpose -- given two trees, it seeks the least-general
generalization of the pair and produces a triplet representing the generalized tree with
a metavariable introduced where the two differ, as well as a substitution set that allows
the metavariable to be replaced with the appropriate concrete subtree necessary to
reconstitute the two trees that were antiunified.
