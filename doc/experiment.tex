\section{Experimental results}

We tested the methodology outlined in section~\ref{sec:method} on the
publicly available git repositories for two popular open source
projects, the ANTLR parser generator and the Clojure language implementation.
Both are implemented in Java, and one (ANTLR) is composed of a mixture of
hand-written and automatically generated code.
