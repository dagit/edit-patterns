\section{Conclusions}

We have shown that patterns of change over the lifetime of a project can
be obtaned through analysis of its version control history.  The use of
tree differencing and tree similarity measures, as well as the anti-unification
algorithm for computing generalized patterns, allows this large volume of difference data to be distilled into a compact form in which changes can be
studied at the level of the base language syntax.  Analysis of the size and
count of groups of similar changes as a function of a similarity threshold
provides a disciplined way to identify generalizations of changes identified by
the tool.

Our work has been performed using a generic, language neutral term
representation allowing the same techniques to be applied to other languages
given appropriate parsing infrastructure and a mapping from language-specific
abstract syntax forms to the generic annotated term form.  Minimal
parameterization of the tool is necessary to then consume these terms, with
language-specific parameters largely focused on specific nodes within the term
that correspond to semantically useful subtree roots for providing context to
tree differences.
