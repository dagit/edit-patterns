\section{Introduction}
%% 1. Describe the problem

Version control systems (VCS's) track the evolution of software over time in the form
of a sequence of changes to the plain text representation of the code.
We would like to be able to characterize the changes to files in a software
project according to the type of change that they represent.  The ability to
map these changes to the syntax of the language, instead of its raw text
representation, will allow them to be understood in terms of the language
constructs themselves.  Doing so will allow us to identify patterns of
changes at the abstract syntax level to support insight at a deeper level
than achievable by examining raw text differences.  For example, in
an operating system kernel, a set of drivers may need to be updated to use a
new mutual exclusion mechanism. In this example, blocks of code that access
specific resources need to be updated to take a semaphore before proceeding.

Finding common patterns for the changes to a source file gives us the ability
to understand, at a higher level, what sorts of revisions are happening. If we
already know to look for changes to semaphore handling we may think to use a
textual search tool, such as {\tt grep}, to search the source code for
functions related to semaphores. Instead, suppose we have the challenge that we
are not familiar with the source code and we would like to understand at a
structural level what types of changes were needed to add support for the new
semaphores.

Furthermore, 

\claim{Finding edit patterns in source code is a hard problem.}

%% 2. State our contributions

Our contributions described in this work are:

\begin{itemize}

\item We show that structural differencing algorithms that operate on the abstract
syntax tree or parse tree of a language can be used to map text differences stored in
a VCS to a form where syntactic changes can be reasoned about.

\item We show that the anti-unification algorithm of BLAH can be used to map
similar changes to a generalized change pattern.

\item We show that clustering by a tree similarity metric allows differences to be grouped
such that the families of changes to generalize via anti-unification can be inferred from
the differences using a basic similarlity threshold.

\end{itemize}

In this paper, we briefly describe the building blocks of our work and show preliminary results
of this methodology as applied to version control repositories for open source projects available
online.  The projects studied in this paper are X, Y, and Z.  In lieu of a stand-alone discussion of
related work, we will present the work that we have based our research on inline with the associated
topics.

\section{Methodology}

We propose the following workflow for studying software evolution via VCS
data.  First, each version of all source files in the project are
reconstituted from the differences stored within the VCS such that each
version of a file can be parsed by an appropriate language front end.  Each
front-end is configured to map the parsed code to an annotated term (or,
aterm)~\cite{brand00aterm} that represents a standardized serialization of the parse
tree or abstract syntax tree.  Mapping languages to a common aterm format allows
the downstream portions of our workflow to be language-agnostic to a large degree,
with minimal language-specific parameterization.  

Once we have code in an aterm format, we can then apply a structural
differencing algorithm between adjacent versions of each source file (e.g.,
version $n$ of file $f$ is compared to version $n+1$ of file $f$).  The result
of this is a forest of trees that represent the portions of the AST of file
$f$ that changed between versions at the structural level.  These changes can
either be code insertions, deletions, or mutations.  Our differencing is based
on the work of Yang~\cite{yang91diff} whose algorithm was designed for computing
differences between source code versions.  Yang's goal was to improve the
visual presentation of differences in textual diff tools, and our use of their
algorithm to provide input to further tree analysis algorithms is novel.

After reducing the sequence of differences stored in the VCS, we have a large
forest of trees each representing a change that occurred over the evolution of
the software.  At this point, we seek to relate each of these trees via a 
tree similarity metric.  This is achieved by using Yang's algorithm a second time,
but in this case we ignore the sequence of edit operations that it produces and
simply consume the quantitative similarity metric that it produces as a rough
estimate of how closely related two trees are.  (TODO: where to discuss the fact that
this is not a commutative operator).  A threshold parameter is defined in which
two trees with a similarity above the threshold are considered to be part of the same
cluster of difference tress.

Finally, once the set of differences are grouped into clusters of trees that
are similar up to the threshold, we perform antiunification on the entire
cluster to distill all members to a representative code pattern for the
cluster.  The antiunification algorithm as described by WHO~\cite{antiu} as
part of the clonedigger project was used, which itself is an implementation of
the classical antiunitification algorithm of THATGUY~\cite{who}.

In the following sections, we descibe the steps above in greater detail.

%% The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for

%% In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
%% \textbf{section} is used to
%% indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
%% designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
%% a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
%% hierarchical structure
%% \textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
%% highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
