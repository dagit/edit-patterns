\title{Identifying change patterns in software history}

%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{2} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

%% Submitted abstract
%%Traditional algorithms for detecting differences in source code focus on
%%differences between lines.  As such, little can be learned about abstract
%%changes that occur over time within a project.  Structural differencing on the
%%program parse tree reveals changes at the syntactic level within code, which
%%allows us to further process the differences to understand their meaning. We
%%propose that clustering of changes by some metric of similarity, followed by
%%pattern extraction via antiunification will allow us to identify patterns of
%%change  within a software project from the sequence of changes contained
%%within a Version Control System (VCS). Tree similarity metrics such as a tree
%%edit distance can be used to cluster changes in order to identify groupings
%%that may represent a single class of change (e.g., adding a
%%parameter to a function call). By applying antiunification within each cluster
%%we are able to generalize from families of concrete changes to patterns of
%%structural change. Studying patterns of change at the structural level,
%%instead of line-by-line, allows us to gain insight into the evolution of
%%software.

% The following two commands are all you need in the

\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{sigproc}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex

%% %Appendix A
%% \section{Headings in Appendices}
%% The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
%% the body of the article are different in the appendices.
%% In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
%% \textbf{section} is used to
%% indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
%% designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
%% a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
%% hierarchical structure
%% \textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
%% highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
%% document in Appendix-appropriate form:
%% \subsection{Introduction}
%% \subsection{The Body of the Paper}
%% \subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
%% \subsubsection{Math Equations}
%% \paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
%% \paragraph{Display Equations}
%% \subsubsection{Citations}
%% \subsubsection{Tables}
%% \subsubsection{Figures}
%% \subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
%% \subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
%% \subsection{Conclusions}
%% \subsection{Acknowledgments}
%% \subsection{Additional Authors}
%% This section is inserted by \LaTeX; you do not insert it.
%% You just add the names and information in the
%% \texttt{{\char'134}additionalauthors} command at the start
%% of the document.
%% \subsection{References}
%% Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
%% then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
%% to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
%% the .tex source file and comment out
%% the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
%% % This next section command marks the start of
%% % Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy
%% \section{More Help for the Hardy}
%% The acm\_proc\_article-sp document class file itself is chock-full of succinct
%% and helpful comments.  If you consider yourself a moderately
%% experienced to expert user of \LaTeX, you may find reading
%% it useful but please remember not to change it.
%% \balancecolumns
%% % That's all folks!
